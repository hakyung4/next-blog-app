# Next.js Blog Application

I created this blog web application to post and share whatever I want.
Built with Next.js and tailwind CSS.

*In order to fetch and display new posts, I have to push an empty commit.*

*Posts written in either Korean or English.*
```
git commit --allow-empty -m "push to prod"
git push origin main
```
